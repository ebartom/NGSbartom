Welcome!

If you would like to analyze Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data with CETO, you need to first do the following:

 - Get an account on Quest
   You will need storage space of your own to store your data.
   http://www.it.northwestern.edu/secure/forms/research/allocation-request.html
 
 - Request access to allocation p20742 (owned by Elizabeth Bartom ebartom@northwestern.edu )
   This allocation contains the Ceto code as well as a variety of reference genomes and transcriptomes and some test data.
   https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=71afee7a6a014e94b1299fa947ef43c5

 - Request access to the genomics nodes on Quest
   http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/user-services/quest/genomics.html 

 - Try logging on to Quest
   http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/user-services/quest/logon.html

Once you have access to Quest, you need install the R packages used by Ceto.  You can choose to install only those genomes relevant to your research.

Copy and paste the following in to the command line:

#load R
module load R/3.2.2

# open R
R

# Set up R packages
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10")
biocLite("BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9")
biocLite("BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")
biocLite("BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38")
biocLite("BSgenome.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer3")
biocLite("ChIPpeakAnno")
biocLite("topGO")

# exit R
q()

You will get an error pointing out that you cannot install R libraries for everyone.  That’s fine.  Accept the program’s proposal that R libraries be installed in your personal directory.


Next, transfer your sequence data on to Quest:

You are now ready to start analyzing your data!

RNAseq data

Log on to Quest.

cd /projects/p20742/testRNA/

# Make a directory for your analysis results (Substitute b1025 with your allocation throughout)
outputDirectory=/projects/b1025/testOutput/
mkdir $outputDirectory

# Change to the directory you just made.
cd $outputDirectory

# Build the pipeline scripts in that directory.
/projects/p20742/tools/buildPipelineScripts.pl \
    -t RNA \
    -o $outputDirectory \
    -g mm10 \
    -f /projects/p20742/testRNA/fastq \
    -c /projects/p20742/testRNA/comparisons.csv \
    -uploadASHtracks 0 \
    -runAlign 1 \
    -runEdgeR 1 \
    >& buildPipelineScripts.testRNA.log & 


# Check on the status of your jobs running on the cluster 
showq -u ${USER}

# Look at the arguments we used above:

# The fastq directory
ls /projects/p20742/testRNA/fastq

# The comparisons file
more /projects/p20742/testRNA/comparisons.csv

# Look for files created by Ceto:
ls $outputDirectory/testRNA/

# Poke around in the resulting files
more $outputDirectory/testRNA/scripts/run_mESc-2i-RNA-DMSO-REP1_align.sh
# These are the commands that are being run by Ceto

# Wait about 8 hours for Ceto to finish running, and then explore the contents of the output directory


# Try a different fastq directory and comparisons file.  Can you run your own analysis?
